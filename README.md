Question: "What is the relationship between age groups, specific health conditions, and COVID-19 mortality rates in different U.S. states?"

This question addresses the complex interplay between age, pre-existing health conditions, and COVID-19 outcomes. By analyzing the dataset, we will be able to investigate whether certain age groups are more susceptible to severe outcomes and if the presence of specific health conditions amplifies this risk. Furthermore, we will be able to explore regional variations, as different states may have different healthcare systems, demographics, and policies that impact these relationships. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the factors influencing COVID-19 mortality. In the real world, this could be used in aiding in targeted interventions and healthcare resource allocation.
